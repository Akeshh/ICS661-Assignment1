# ICS661-Assignment1

This repository contains the code and report for the ICS661 Assignment 1. The task involved developing a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model to classify data using a pre-partitioned training and testing set. Below is an overview of the work completed.

## Overview

- **Model Architecture**: A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) was built with three hidden layers using the PyTorch framework. Each layer includes ReLU activation, Batch Normalization, and Dropout for regularization.
  
- **Experimentation**: Various experiments were conducted by:
  - Changing the number of hidden layers and neurons.
  - Testing different optimizers (Adam, AdamW, and SGD).
  - Adjusting dropout rates to understand their effect on model performance.
  
- **Performance Evaluation**: The model was evaluated using accuracy and F1-score. The final model achieved high performance, with an accuracy and F1-score of over 98%.

## Files Included

- **`train.zip` & `test.csv`**: The dataset used for training and evaluation.
- **`ICS661_Assignment1.ipynb`**: Source codes for implementation.
- **`Assignment1_report.docx`**: The final report detailing the model architecture, experiments, and performance results.
